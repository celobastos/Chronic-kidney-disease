# Chronic-kidney-disease
Here we did an application, for the subject of Statistics, that would predict if a person has or not a chronic kidney disease, for that we used the naive bayes method and also compared the results from this methology with other kinds of predictors, like the decision tree.

The technologies used for this project were the Google colab, using the python tools and libraries for the model training, like sklearn. In addition to that we used pandas, numpy and matplot to make the model work properly.
